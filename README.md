This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on a dataset related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) by a Portuguese banking institution.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about clients who were contacted through phone calls. The goal of the classification is to predict whether or not a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features like age, job, marital status, education, and contact information.
